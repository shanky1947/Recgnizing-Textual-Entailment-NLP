It solves RTE (Recognizing textual entailment) problem using sentence extraction to cover semantic variation by extracting subject, predicate and object from each sentence.

## Dataset
Dataset used is Third Pascal Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge
(RTE-3) dataset. It has approximately has 800 pairs text (T) and
hypothesis (H) with labels as True or False showing whether T entails H
or not.

## Methodology
* Preprocessing- Formation of parse tree using Stanford NLP library. ÔÅ¨ Sentence extraction- Used part of speech and parse tree for
sentence extraction.
* Part of sentence extraction- Subject, Predicate and Object- Used part
of speech tag and syntactic parse tree.
* Feature extraction and classifier- TF-IDF is used for word weighing
and feature table is formed. 
* After feature extraction, any classification algorithm can be used to
classify whether the text and hypothesis are entailed or not
